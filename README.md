Hi, I'm Gram and I like making stickers about IT.

Check them out: [stickers.orsinium.dev](https://stickers.orsinium.dev/)

Most of them I drew myself using Inkscape and then ordered from Sticker Mule. Each design comes in a limited edition, 10 or 50 stickers in total, depending on if I use a deal or order a sample. So, if you have one of these stickers, there are at most 49 people in the whole world who have the same one as you.

## Copyrights

* "TypeScript" uses jQuery logo. The logo is a copyright of the jQuery Foundation. [LICENSE](https://brand.jquery.org/logos/)
* "OurPy" contains Bugs Bunny traced from "A Wild Hare" episode of "Loony Toons". The episode is produced by Warner Bros.
* "Patience" is a "clean room" reproduction of [this mug](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1158579643/) from Etsy. Copyright: Tanya.
* "Ship it" contains a traced image of "Mobster squirrel" photo. It became a meme and so now it's hard to trace the author and the origin.
* "Pip" is stilized as the npm logo. The npm logo is copyright of npm, Inc. [LICENSE](https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/logos-and-usage)
* "Generic hero" is partially made using [gopherize.me](https://gopherize.me/). The base artwork used on the website is made by Ashley McNamara. [LICENSE](https://github.com/matryer/gopherize.me/blob/master/LICENSE)

* "Duck typing" is based on a random SVG icon of a snake I found online. I can't find it again now to give a proper attribution.
* "Silly walk" siluette is traced from [this Wikimedia Commons poster](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Silly_Walk_Gait.png). If the attribution is correct, the author is Jazeen Hollings.
* "The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch" is an image I found online and can't find again now to give a proper attribution.
* Python logos are copyrights of Python Software Foundation.

Everything else is produced by me. It is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0. However, primitive figures cannot be copyrighted, so you can legaly freely use the basic shapes from sticker as you wish. On practice, I don't care at all about what you do with my work but I'd appreciate a link to this repo or another form of attribution.
