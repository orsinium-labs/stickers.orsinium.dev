* "TypeScript" uses jQuery logo. The logo is a copyright of the jQuery Foundation. [LICENSE](https://brand.jquery.org/logos/)

* "Ship it" contains a traced image of "Mobster squirrel" photo. It became a meme and so now it's hard to trace the author and the origin.

* "Duck typing" is based on a random SVG icon of a snake I found online. I can't find it again now to give a proper attribution.
* "Silly walk" siluette is traced from [this Wikimedia Commons poster](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Silly_Walk_Gait.png). If the attribution is correct, the author is Jazeen Hollings.
